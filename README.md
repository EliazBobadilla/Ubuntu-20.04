# My Personal Configuration of Ubuntu 20.04

The [setup.sh ](./setup.sh) file it's an executable that will uninstall some annoying programs that come by default in Ubuntu and install some others.(It asks you to install or remove each program.)

To make it executable you must:
```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```
Also you have to run the file as sudo:
```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```
